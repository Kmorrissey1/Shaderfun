# Shaderfun
Shader fun with p5.js!
For my fundamental course in IMGD, I decided to iterate upon my first sketch, which was created from a written description and then translated into code. This is basically my first "technical artwork." Thus, when our class started experimenting with shaders, I knew I wanted to revisit this goofy little guy! By adding a shader, I was able to make the meditation of the judge's decision feel more like a deliberation; you see the waves of color and assume that this is the "loading screen" of judge duck. However, adding the shader, which introduces a bit of 3D-illusion, sort of clashes with the fundamentally 2D, cute artstyle of the duck. However, my hope is that this contrast adds a level of silliness to the sketch. I had to adjust my original code, as the shader overlay interfered with the way strokeWeight and Stroke was showing up. I also could not for the life of me get the shader to extend to the whole canvas despite several attempts at debugging. Such is life!
Here is the code I used, borrowing from Dr. Roberts' model example: https://editor.p5js.org/Kmorrissey1/sketches/h35NQ0x18

Feedback from peer: "magining with it centered correctly It would look awesome, I and that same problem as well initially but I was able to solve mine through mirroring my effects correctly. But I love the way it fills the screen over time  and it adds to the vibe checking. If you did mirror it you could create a circle of sorts for a full impact affect affect."
